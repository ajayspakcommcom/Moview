Dear Apple Review Team,

We have implemented a comprehensive content moderation system in our app, Moviu, to ensure the safety and appropriateness of user-generated content. Here are the key components:

1. **User Reporting:** Users can report inappropriate content directly within the app. Each report is logged and reviewed manually by our moderation team.
2. **Manual Review:** Our team conducts daily reviews of reported content and user activities to ensure compliance with our community guidelines.
3. **Content Removal and Account Actions:** Inappropriate content is promptly removed, and users who violate our guidelines may have their accounts suspended or deleted. Users are notified of these actions with reasons provided.
4. **Community Guidelines:** All users agree to our terms of use and community guidelines, which are clearly outlined in the app.

We are committed to maintaining a safe and positive environment for our users. Please let us know if further information is needed.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
